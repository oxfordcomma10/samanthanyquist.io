  <p1>Hi! My name is Samantha Nyquist, but most people call me Sammy. I am currently finishing up my Bachelorâ€™s degree through the 
  University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and spending my last semester in Madrid, Spain for a study abroad program! 
  <br> <br>
  Confused on what to do with my life, I ended up taking an introductory course in computer science that primarily used Python and I
  instantly knew that coding was for me. Since then I have been heavily studying mostly backend programming in languages such as Python, Java, C, 
  x86 Assembly, and OCaml in school and Python, JSON, SQL, and AT commands at my internship. During my down time I decided to teach myself 
  HTML, CSS, and Javascript by creating a personal website.
  <br> <br>
  I am always striving to learn more and perfect my coding skills, I especially enjoy teaching myself new languages and finding better ways to 
  implement techniques whether it relates to design or efficiency. I have had the pleasure of working for the cell device company, Nimbelink, 
  in Minnesota helping with internal organization, customer code examples in Python and with several aspects of the Google Cloud Platform, 
  and working with colleagues on complex projects. I hope to gain experience in the web development side of the field in the future and be 
  able to use my experience in backend development to interact with frontend code. 
  <br> <br>
  When I am not coding, one can find me ballroom dancing, traveling, watching musicals, or trying out new restaurants. As I grow as a 
  programmer, I hope to inspire more women and people of color to learn to code and make it more accessible to everyone.
