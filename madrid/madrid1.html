    <p> Left MSP at 12:30 after being dropped off by my bff Cayla Smith and Rizzo. Reflected on the amazing night I had prior with most of my
    best friends and family, thankful for their love and support and excited for the journey ahead. I was very sad having to say goodbye to 
    the people that I love so much, and quite frankly terrified of probably not seeing most of them for 4 months, something I had never done
    before. I had a layover at JFK for about 3 hours. The flight from MSP to JFK was mostly uneventful, I made sure I had a window seat on every
    flight so I was able to catch glimpses of the Minneapolis skyline and eventually Manhattan. I did not explore too much of JFK while I was 
    there, just ended up watching Tik Toks and having lots of anxious feelings. However once I got on the plane after having to check my carry-on 
    since I was one of the last people to board the plane, I sat at my window seat and attempted to sleep. Anyone who knows me knows that 
    I am the worst at falling asleep so it was no shock that I was unable to sleep on the 7 hour flight. I ended up watching Schitt's Creek and
    some of In the Heights while chomping on some airline food that included cheese ravioli and a breakfast sandwich. Both of which were not too bad.
    We crossed into Europe right when the sun rose so I was able to see cute small Spanish towns, mountains, and vineyards as we got closer to Madrid.
    During this part of the trip was the moment that it hit me. I am spending 3.5 months in Spain. On my own. It was finally real. </p>

    <p>We landed at around 8:30 am local time. I was exausted and in shock as I existed the plane and walked the entire length of the airport 
    to passport check. The customs officers did not acknowledge my existence at all which was rude. I found my luggage and my checked bag 
    was wrapped in plastic because the zipper broke open and Delta made sure my stuff would not fall out, a very nice service. 
    After waiting 3 hours for our bus to our homes, we started to drop off people at their apartments. I ended up sitting by my roommates,
    Eva and Katira. I talked to Eva for the majority of the bus ride. She is from the Chicago suburbs, and would not shut up about it. I really
    thought that she would be cool, she seemed nice, but eventually she literally unironically said "I'm not like other girls, I like watching 
    sports" I was in shock. She did not just say that! LOL. Anyway We eventually were brought to our apartment, Calle de Valencia, 5. We found out 
    that we were going to be living with other international students, a shock to us, but I did not mind. I knew that it was a possibility.
    Eva however flipped out. Once we were given our room assignments she continuted to freak out and say "OMG my room is so much smaller than theirs,"
    referencing me and Katira's rooms. I ended up switching with her because I could not deal with drama relating to her. I got settled in, moved
    the various furniture pieces around, put up my clothes, and made my bed, only after getting the thinnest IKEA goods as possible from some 
    random dudes. I along with Katira, Eva, and a girl named Addie that lives in the same apartment building walked around our new neighborhood looking
    for places to eat and noted grocery stores and various interesting spots. We found lots of fruit stands, and other random stores. We ended up
    buying towels, hangers, and a Diet Coke liter from a place called La Tienda de las Amigas, a Michaels in a way, without the crafts. We then got
    pizza at the place half a block away from our apartment. My lack of Spanish skills showed through there as I tried to order. I eventually got
    the point across thanks to the other girls in the group who know Spanish better, but still a rough time. I had a delicous glass of white wine,
    a pizza that I devoured very quickly as Eva complained about our living situation to Katira. I was not in the mood. After eating food we returned
    to the apartment and I was quickly off to bed at 7pm. I slept until 9 the next day. </p>

    <p>We had orientation at 10am at the school this day so Addie, Eva, Katira, and I attempted to find our school which was only a 12 minute walk away.
    However, it is mostly uphill which was not awesome. By the end of this semester my butt is going to look so great. Orientation was rough, boring,
    and not very helpful. After orientation, the leaders brought us to La Puerta del Sol, one of the main plazas in Madrid. From there me and about 20
    students wandered around the nearby streets trying to find somewhere to eat when a man approached us and told us to follow him. We ended up walking
    down a random street to what ended up being the same restaurant as where the man first approached us, just in a different location.
    I had a yummy glass of wine, and us as a group shared our food goods. I ordered mushrooms and ended up eating roasted peppers, calamari,
    tortilla de patatas (I think), and various other potato goods. After paying, we ended up at a large Zara in a touristy area of the city that had
    4 floors. I bought 5 items, all on sale, totally around $60 USD. After Zara, some people split off and we ended up wandering around the area. 
    We found a fun statue and a beautiful park. A few fancy hotels like the Ritz. We ended up at a stunning church near the Prado, a famous Spanish
    art museum. Soon we walked home and went grocery shopping. I just got shampoo, conditioner, bread, cheese, and bananas. That night I met up with
    a few people at a fun bar called Mamva that had super fun drinks for about the same price as cocktails in the city. Mine was called Maktrioska, 
    Russian stacking dolls. It came with a shot of vodka in one and a fun fruity drink in the other. Other peoples' included a bathtub, popcorn
    bucket, and a bicycle. The bar was pretty small so we left after finishing our drinks and met up with some girls that were unable to sit with us.
    We went to a bar called Wanderlust where there were like 6 other people there. However, it was a fun vibe even though the group was tired and 
    still trying to get to know one another. I met a girl that went to high school with Cayla and a girl named Zoey that did dance team at Sartell
    so we ended up talking about dance team for a long time. Addie, Katira, and I walked home after the bar at around 2 am.</p>

    <p> This morning we had a tour of Madrid done by one of the teachers at the Fundacion. Before then Katira, Addie, Eva, and I grabbed breakfast at a cute cafe near the school.
     There was an English and Spanish tour, I obviously chose
    the English route since I actually wanted to understand what was happening during the tour. Our guide showed us around several plazas and landmarks
    including areas that Napolean would hold hangings. She pointed out architectural styles and their time periods which was fascinating. One 
    plaza had four different buildings, one from the 1500s, 1600s, 1700s, and 1900s, it was incredible to see since all of the buildings look 
    different but have obvious differences which called for a beautiful view. We were able to see the palace that the king and queen do their  
    royal doings. Today was the first day of feeling the large amount of walking, mostly uphill, that I do on a daily basis. Worth it. Hoping for 
    a fantasic ass by the end of my program. After the tour me and 7 other girls in the English tour went to a tapas restaurant near La puerta 
    del sol and I got a red wine along with assorted sandwiches that we all shared. After lunch I went home and took a nap in preparation for the 
    night ahead, since it was a Friday. After a fantasic siesta I started getting ready for the night. I met up with a bunch of classmates 
    at a tiny bar that we knew would not fit everyone, there were estimated 15 of us all trying to go out together. We tried a few bars from there,
    most not being super successful since it was nearing midnight. We found a karaoke bar and we knew that we needed to go. It was a 10 Euro cover
    fee that included one cocktail, not a bad deal. I got a Vodka and Sprite, because I knew it would be the same in Spanish, vodka y Sprite por 
    favor. Many followed my lead and it ended up being a good drink. Many songs in English were sung by the locals, or whomever was singing. 
    Songs by ABBA were a hit along with the Spanish version of Friend Like Me from the Jungle Book. Met some new people on the trip, sang along, 
    went to the bathroom with some girls and embarrassed ourselves, particularly with Nada because we accidently turned off the light that lit up
    one of the stalls and after we turned it back on the girl was like gracias! We died laughing. As a group we decided to check out the popular
    (probably mostly tourist) club called el Teatro Kapital, however the line was along the building. We got pushed around as Nada tried to push us 
    towards the front. We were unsuccessful. We lost the group as they returned to the karaoke bar and we slipped into a Hookah bar. Unfortunatly
    they did not have alcohol, but Nada and Addie did the Hookah. We were required to get a non alcoholic drink which blew but was yummy anyway.
    While sitting as the quiet hookah bar a guy came over and spoke with us. He said he was from North Dakota and had been stationed in Seville and 
    had just been released from duty. He invited us to split a table at kaptial for the next night, we said sure, but we are hot girls, we should
    not be paying for shit. We left the hookah bar and made our way down the street to teatro kapital. Luckily by 2 am there was not much of a line
    to get in. As we walked in being stared at by scary Russian looking bouncers, I gave 20 Euros to the club, that came with one drink, again not 
    too bad for a popular club on a Friday night. The club was huge. 7 floors, 5 of which looked over the main dance floor with a bad DJ playing
    2009-2013 pop hits with EDM. We danced for a while, yelled at the poor bartender for a drink (because it was so loud), another vodka Sprite of
    course, and explored the club. Nada must go out a lot because she was so confident just walking places and talking to random people. Eventually 
    she got us in with some dude that bought her and Addie a shot, I declined since I did not want to be too drunk, especially not on my first Friday
    in Madrid. He eventually invited us up to his table on the top floor looking over the dance floor, on top of the stage lights, not a great spot 
    for dancing. Nada and the guy made out while Amira and I complained about the music and danced. Addie talked to the guys friend during this. 
    After a while I looked over and Nada was on the couch by the table on top of the guy and I pointed it out to Amira and she rushed to pull Nada
    off the man. We then all decided that it would be a good time to leave. So we said thank you and left. Nada and Amira got a taxi and Addie and 
    I walked home, since the Metro was not yet open. I got home and facetimed Matt since it was about 11 pm Minnesota time. I went to bed around 6 am.</p>

    <p> Did not wake up until nearly 3pm and quickly went to lunch near la puerta del sol with Zoey and Riley. We got some delicous paella and croquetas
    from a restaurant that we just happened upon. I do not know how people navigate the entire city, I'm sure they don't, there are so many places  
    to go and eat at, it's amazing. After a fantastic lunch we shopped at Zara and various other stores near la puerta del sol. I did not buy any
    clothes this time, but once we walked into El Corte de Ingles, I knew it was all over. It's like Macy's on crack. It has like 6 levels of clothing, 
    fancy accessories like watches, and the bottom floor had a grocery store, I got some yummy snacks like chocolate crossiants, chocolate rice 
    cakes, and waffle chip things. I did self checkout and did not grab a bag so I awkwardly had to hold my snacks until I got home. After grocery 
    shopping Zoey and I decided to head back home for a nap since teatro kapital was on the agenda for the night. After a nice nap and call with Matt 
    I started getting ready for going out. I got frustrated since plans weren't being made beyond we were going to pregame somewhere and go to 
    kapital. Eventually we figured out that we would go to a bar called el Diario to pregame since it closed at midnight, and had 5 euro mojitos, 
    how can one deny that!? Zoey and I made our way to el diario and met up with Leo and Harrison. We all chitchatted for a while and soon Carolyn 
    and Kat showed up. We ordered our drinks, most of us getting the mojito and some got beer. The mojito was amazing, I saw them pressing the mint 
    and everything. I ordered another one a bit before the bar closed and we then made our way to kapital. We made it by 12:30 and the line was once 
    again long and curved around the building. We ended up waiting in it, but it wasn't too bad. We once again went through the scary Russian bouncers 
    and paid 22 Euros for two drinks and entrance. We started by dancing as a big group and then explored. We found a karaoke section of the club  
    whose bar was not as crowded as the main dance floor and I ordered yet another vodka sprite. We then kept exploring and messing around as we got 
    more tipsy. While we were dancing on the main floor I ran into my favorite person in the whole world that just happened to be in Madrid for the 
    weekend, Molly S. I did the fake omg hi, she obviously did not care to see me which was fine, I just needed to have the story that I ran into 
    her. I remember the whole night, just the order of events is not clear haha. At one point Carolyn and I did swing/hustle and taught Leo how to 
    do the pretzel. We spent a lot of time dancing and exploring and dealing with slight drama around other girls in our program that were drunk 
    and ditzy, but overall fun regardless. Towards the end of the night we found ourselves in the middle of the dance floor and the single girls 
    were dancing with random guys. Luckily some of the people in our group have significant others so we just hung out together. By 5 am my feet 
    were absolutly killing me, I wore my white boot heels. We danced until 5:30am and all felt a bit defeated from the long night and left the club.
    We sat outside the McDonalds down the block as some girls got snacks. Tired and tipsy we all laughed and joked around, it was so fun. Zoey and 
    I rode together back to our homes. I ended up riding the Metro with her until her stop and got on the opposite train back to mine. By the time
    I got home it was 7am and me being me did not go to sleep until 8am. I went to bed feeling very happy.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1/23/2022</h3>
    <p>Not my favorite day of the program so far. I woke up at 5pm and saw that some of the people that I had hung out with the last night were at a park
    without me so that sucked. However it being the Sunday before the first day of class I sucked it up and prepared for the semester. Matt 
    confirmed that he wants to come visit me here for a week during his spring break so I became very happy very quick. Cayla and I also 
    solidified more dates which also brought me lots of joy. I spent the rest of the afternoon researching Airbnbs in Madrid and the Canary islands,
    had a couple glasses of wine and talked with Matt with his visit. I later talked to Cayla about her visit too and went to bed happy to remember 
    that despite my insecurities with the people here in Spain, I have a wonderful boyfriend and best friend sitting in my corner. </p>

    <p>The first day of class. I did not have to be at school until 12pm so I woke up at around 10:45 and headed to the cute cafe a block away from 
    the school and watched Tik Toks while sipping on a cafe con leche and a crossiant. I had been there before the tour and the same cute lady was
    working. I gave myself 15 minutes to walk to school and find the classroom, I found it within 3 minutes so killed some time sitting in the school
    and eventually at 12 got to my first class: Culture, Globalization, and the Media. Luckily it is in English and there are about 10 people in 
    the class. The professor, David, was very engaging and emphasized that the class would cover sensitve issues and require dialoge between him
    and ourselves. I am very excited for the class since I am minoring in Political Science, and I love history. After that class I had Spanish 
    Civilization in the same classroom immediately after so I just sat in my seat as people transitioned in and out of the class. Some of my friends 
    that I went out with on Saturday showed up to the Spanish class so I sat by them and they told me that they had gone to a Catholic mass on 
    Sunday, I suppose I did not miss too much did I? haha. I was terrified coming into the class given my Spanish was not doing well out with the 
    locals beforehand. However the professor Isabel spoke very clearly at a good speed and I understood the majority of what she said, missing a 
    word here and there, but typical for Spanish class. I realized that the issues I have out and about relate to the locals speaking fast, slurred,
    and there always being loud music, so as a non native speaker it is a lot harder to hear and assume things in those situations. Hopefully the 
    class will familiarize myself with the language better and give me more confidence. After class I walked back home and stopped at carefour, the 
    abierto (open) 24/7 grocery store with a little pharmacy in the back. I picked up a weeks worth of groceries including tortilla de patatas,
    sushi for lunch, and various other goods like the .75 euro coffees. After that I came home, ate the sushi and headed out for some shopping. 
    Since la puerta de sol area was busy and overwhelming on Saturday, I decided a Monday afternoon would be a good time to shop with less crowds.
    I was correct for the majority of it, but by 6pm everyone was off work and also shopping. I wandered around el corte de ingles for probably over
    an hour looking for whatever I could find and walked out with a bra, tights, 2 bottles of wine, and laundry detergent. Since these goods were 
    quite heavy I thought that taking the Metro would be a better idea than walking. The Metro was packed, but I was able to squeeze in since I 
    only needed to travel one station over. I dropped off my stuff and got dinner with Addie at a restaurant practically across the street from 
    our apartment. We had a nice chat, got a glass of white wine for 1.90 Euros, calamari, and an empanada with carne. A more expensive establishment
    than preferred for being regulars, but I am glad we tried it out. Got home and journaled, texted Matt and drinking some wine. It is amazing that 
    most of the wine is from Spain like it can be so cheap, delicious, and just a great time. Hoping to have a better week and possibly plan a weekend 
    trip. </p>
