# Hey besties
Welcome to my website. I am teaching myself HTML, Javascript, and CSS so ignore any stupid logic or easy to fix things. This is a passion project that I am doing for fun so thanks for checking out my Github I guess?

## Pokemon Type Quiz
I made this because I feel like tests like this are always wrong whereas I am always right. The math is kinda random so idk if it's possible to get some or not.

## Everything else
Please ignore
