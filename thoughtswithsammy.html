    <h2>Welcome to Sammy's niche thoughts</h2>
    <h3>*Niche thoughts are thoughts that almost nobody would understand either because the people are extremely separated or most are not aware of the comparison.*</h3>

    <article>
    <p>1. (The original niche thought) Riley D. is the Cherry A. of Florida.</p>
    <p>2. Douche guys love C.</p>
    <p>3. Pokemon is just online dog fighting.</p>
    <p>4. I felt violated when I was asked by a man (who I thought was gay) if he could kiss me while I was at the Saloon at 1:45am on a Monday.</p>
    <p>5. My music taste is just what gay men listened to 5-10 years ago.</p>
    <p>6. It is only natural that Isabella and I know what SuperWhoLock is and it is even more embarrassing that Isabella watched all of them.</p>
